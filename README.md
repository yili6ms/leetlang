# leetlang
Toy Language Impl

The motivation of implementing this toy language is for fun :).
The grammar of this language is very simple, but combines with several interesting features.

The only entry point is program, now it supports four arithmetic operations, boolean expression, if-else statement, while loop, function definition and function call.

Supported type is just int, boolean and void. later will add native array support.

Execution is based on AST, and the AST is generated by parser, which is implemented by leex and yecc.

Later will add JIT support and LLVM integration.

Example code:

``` leetlang
program abc
{
  let_fn fib = (n -> int) -> int {
    let c = 1
    if (n >= 3) {
      let a =  fib.(n-1)
      let b = fib.(n-2)
      let c = a + b
    }
    return c
  }
  let ans = fib.(10)
}
```
## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `leetlang` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:leetlang, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/leetlang>.
